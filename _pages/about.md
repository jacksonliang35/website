Hi, there! I'm a postdoctoral researcher at The Ohio State University, advised by [Yingbin Liang](https://sites.google.com/view/yingbinliang/). Before this, I obtained my Ph.D. in the Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) in 2023, advised by [Venugopal V. Veeravalli](https://vvv.ece.illinois.edu/). Prior to this, I received my B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering in 2019, also from UIUC.

My research focuses on generative models and statistical inference, aiming to understand the mathematical foundations of existing algorithms and to design new methods that are both theoretically sound and practically effective. Some of my recent interests include:
* Discrete diffusion models, especially masked diffusion models
* Conditional diffusion models and posterior sampling
* Statistical inference under model uncertainty and mismatch
* Quickest change detection, anomaly detection, and sequential analysis
